# chess
created a chess program from basic  c  language
This contains features like:
The chess pieces could be accessed by mentioning the row and column which is displayed in the board while debugging
 moving chess  pieces to the desired user input location 
 The locations where ever the chess pieces could be moved  is told by the function when you choose the piece
This program also contains the check function which checks the king respectively and returns a illegal  if the king isnt moved upon a check
(basic chess interface is given in which you have to use ur logic)
It terminates the game and declares the winner when the player reaches 3 illegal moves (rules from chess).
The above logic is used for checkmate too.
As you know when its a checkmate its impossible to move the king anywhere. so this logic is used.
